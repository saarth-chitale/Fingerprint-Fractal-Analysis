# **Fingerprint Fractal Analysis**

This code was written by Saarth Chitale in order to process images obtained from fingerprint reading device and compute number of fractals using fractal analysis.

## Initialize
- Fingerprint image obtained from a reader needs to be converted into a matrix (using MATLAB or similar tools).

## Pre-Process
- The binarized image file is then binarized using Otsu method via Fortan subroutine in binarize.F95.
- The image is then reduced until a workable area is obtained in order to minimize white space. The relevant subrountines are located in preprocess.F95.

## Generating Fractals
- Define maximum number of hops by setting _nmax_ in main.F95. Additionally, define the number of scale on which fractals should be generated by setting _numscales_.
- Fractal generation subroutines like _randomwalk_ and _chaos_ can be used depending on requirements. While _randomwalk_ yields simplest results, _chaos_ generates better quality fractals and should be used if enough processing power is available.
- Fractal counting and plotting files are then generated which can be processed via a plotting software.

## Note
Run the _Makefile_ to generate executable _ffa_. Name of image file obtained from _Initialize_ step should follow executable file name.
